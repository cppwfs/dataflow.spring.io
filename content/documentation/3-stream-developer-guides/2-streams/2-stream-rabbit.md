# Stream Processing with RabbitMQ

We will start from initializr and create two Spring Cloud Stream applications and run them locally using the Rabbit binder. Show some basic variations in Rabbit Binding properties.

## Development

Explaine what we are doing to do development wise.
The source can use an @Scheduled annotation that triggers every few seconds and send a simple domain object. The sink can log the incoming payload.

### Initialzr

Go to initializr - maybe have a curl command ready to go do we can just download a ready made .zip.

### Biz Logic

Your biz logic is coded in this section,

### Testing

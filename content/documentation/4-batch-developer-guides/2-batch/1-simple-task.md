# Batch Processing with Spring Cloud Task

In this guide we will develop a batch application using Spring Cloud Task and deploy it to Cloud Foundry, Kubernetes, and on your local machine. In another guide, we will deploy the Task using Data Flow.

We will start from initializr and create two Spring Cloud Batch applications.
Note for CF we need a manifest, for k8s we need a service/deployment yaml.

## Development

Explaine what we are doing to do development wise.

Create a simple task (timestamp)

### Initialzr

Go to initializr - maybe have a curl command ready to go do we can just download a ready made .zip.

### Biz Logic

Your biz logic is coded in this section,

### Testing

Show a simple test.

## Deployment

Deploy to local, Cloud Foundry and Kubernetes

### Local

get the jar run it bla

### Cloud Foundry

As Alana I must ask for an org/space

### Kubernetes

Where all the cool kids play.

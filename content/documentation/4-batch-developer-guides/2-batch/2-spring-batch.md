# Batch Processing with Spring Batch

In this guide we will develop a Spring Batch application and deploy it to Cloud Foundry, Kubernetes, and on your local machine. In another guide, we will deploy the Spring Batch application using Data Flow.

We will start from initializr and create a Spring Batch application.
Note for CF we need a manifest, for k8s we need a service/deployment yaml.

## Development

Explaine what we are doing to do development wise.

Create a single step batch job, file item reader, file item writer, no other dependencies outside of spring batch.

### Initialzr

Go to initializr - maybe have a curl command ready to go do we can just download a ready made .zip.

### Biz Logic

Your biz logic is coded in this section,

### Testing

Show a simple test.

## Deployment

Deploy to local, Cloud Foundry and Kubernetes

### Local

get the jar run it bla

### Cloud Foundry

As Alana I must ask for an org/space

### Kubernetes

Where all the cool kids play.
